                <h2>Best Pork Fried Rice</h2>
                <p>A great recipe for leftover pork chops, roasts, and more. A few bits from the fridge turn into a tasty dinner in less than 45 minutes. If I have a leftover grilled pork or the tail of a roast, I'll freeze it until I have enough for this dish. You can also use chicken or substitute some of the veggies for what you have on hand when cleaning out the fridge. Serve with sweet Thai chili sauce on the side.</p>
